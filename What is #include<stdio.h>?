Means it will include the header file before compiling the code. " include" gives command to include something.
"stdio" stands for "standard input output".
As it is a header file so .h extension is there. 
It contains some standard functions related to input and output such as "printf", "scanf" etc.
eg: #include<stdio.h>
    #include<stdlib.h>
    #include<conio.h>
